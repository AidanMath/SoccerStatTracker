# SoccerStatTracker
Fun little side project I made to help learn about APIs. Tracks different stats among the top 5 leagues in soccer. Using "https://www.api-football.com" It will show you standings for whatever season you wish as well as an in depth analysis into the stats for individual teams for that season. I integrated this using TKinter in python for the GUI.
